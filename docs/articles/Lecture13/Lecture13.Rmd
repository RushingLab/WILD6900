## Capture-mark-recapture (CMR)

#### CMR includes a **wide** variety of related techniques and models  

--
#### Traditionally, CMR referred to methods of capturing, marking, and then recapturing individuals at some point in the future  

--
#### This results in a **capture-history** for each individual:  

##### Individual 1: $101101$  
##### Individual 2: $011001$  

???

Individual 1 was captured on occasions 1, 3, 4, and 6  

Individual 2 was captured on occasions 2,3, and 6. 

--
#### From the capture-histories, possible to estimate $\large p$

--
#### With $\large p$, possible to estimate $\large N$

$$\large N = \frac{C}{p}$$

---
## Capture-mark-recapture

#### From capture-histories, we can estimate:  

--
- abundance  

--
- detection probability  

--
- survival  

--
- movement  

--
- recruitment  

--
- individual growth  

--
- populations trends

## Capture-mark-recapture


#### CMR methods are not restricted to physical captures and recaptures  

#### *What ties all of these methods together is that we have individual-level capture-histories*

---
## Capture-mark-recapture

#### Key to closed CMR is that because individuals do not enter or leave the population, we assume any 0 in the capture history is non-detection $\large (1-p)$

- in simplest model, easy to translate capture history into probabilistic statements based only on $p$:

.pull-left[
##### Individual 1: $\large 101101$  
##### Individual 2: $\large 011001$  
]

.pull-right[
#### $\large p(1-p)pp(1-p)p$  
#### $\large (1-p)pp(1-p)(1-p)p$
]

<br/>

#### In the CMR literature, the constant $\large p$ model is known at the $M_0$ model ([Otis et al. (1978)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/3830650.pdf?casa_token=Dr4Y3XD5DJAAAAAA:IQA7BkqTFg7_0h2kqbrn20CGZLBbTBBbuAsCWsvdRWD-muQDenn-UVYfpdL3q09ZTmiGGxQBm5vnFV9RomNxOdtBq2c98vOSELdt6-hRyoY52ipEYj4))

---
## The $\LARGE M_0$ model in JAGS

#### In all closed CMR models, $\large N$ is unknown

- we know $n$ but how many individuals were not detected at all?

--
- data augmentation!

--
$$\Large z_i \sim Bernoulli(\psi)$$

--
$$\Large y_{ik} \sim Bernoulli(z_ip)$$

--
$$\Large \psi \sim beta(1,1)$$

$$\Large p \sim beta(1,1)$$

--
$$\Large N = \sum_{i=1}^M z_i$$

---
## Capture-mark-recapture

####  In addition to the $\large M_0$ model, Otis et al. 1978 outlined 3 other basic *closed* CMR "models":

--
- $\large M_t$: variation in $p$ among occasions

$$\large p_1(1-p_2)p_3p_4(1-p_5)p_6$$

--
- $\large M_h$: variation in $p$ among individuals

$$\large p_i(1-p_i)p_ip_i(1-p_i)p_i$$

--
- $\large M_b$: behavioral responses (trap happiness/shyness)

$$\large p(1-c)cc(1-c)c$$

]


---
## Capture-mark-recapture

#### Otis et al. 1978 was seminal because it clarified ways that $\large p$ might vary

--
However, $\large M_0$, $\large M_t$, $\large M_h$, $\large M_b$ are not single models but instead families of models that allow $p$ to vary for different reasons

--
#### In modern Bayesian analysis of closed CMR models, we can use the tools you learned so far in this course to model complex variation in $\large p$

- group effects

- hierarchical structure

- continuous covariates (via GLM)

---
## The $\LARGE M_t$ model in JAGS

#### How do we model $\large p$ as a function of occassion?

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
model{
  omega ~ dbeta(1, 1)
  for(t in 1:T){
    p[t] ~ dbeta(1, 1)
  }
  
  for(i in 1:M){
    z[i] ~ dbern(psi)
    
    for(t in 1:T){
      y[i, t] ~ dbern(p[t] * z[i])
    } # end t
  } # end i
  
  N <- sum(z[1:M])
}
```

---
## The $\LARGE M_t$ model in JAGS

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
model{
  omega ~ dbeta(1, 1)
  for(t in 1:T){
    lp[t] ~ dnorm(mu.p, tau.p)
    logit(p[t]) <- lp[t]
  }
  mu.p ~ dnorm(0, 0.1)
  tau.p ~ dgamma(0.25, 0.25)
  for(i in 1:M){
    z[i] ~ dbern(psi)
    
    for(t in 1:T){
      y[i, t] ~ dbern(p[t] * z[i])
    } # end t
  } # end i
}
```

- What is the difference between this model and the previous? How will this change influence estimates of $p_t$?

---
## Model $\LARGE M_b$

#### Behavioral responses are common in studies that require phyisical captures

- probability of capture $\large \neq$ probability of recapture $(\large c)$

- individuals learn to avoid traps (trap shy; $\large p > c$)

- individuals learn to seek out traps (trap happy; $\large c > p$)


--
#### In the $\large M_b$ models, $\large p$ depends on whether an individual has previously been captured

- response can be permanent or ephemeral 

---
## Model $\LARGE M_b$ in JAGS

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
model{
  omega ~ dbeta(1, 1)
  p ~ dbeta(1, 1)
  c ~ dbeta(1, 1)
  
  for(i in 1:M){
    z[i] ~ dbern(psi)
    
    y[i, 1] ~ dbern(p * z[i])
    
    for(t in 2:T){
      y[i, t] ~ dbern(z[i] * ((1 - y[i, t-1]) * p + y[i, t-1] * c))
    } # end t
  } # end i
  
  N <- sum(z[1:M])
  trap.response <- c - p
}
```


---
## Model $\LARGE M_h$

#### Individual heterogeniety not captured by covariates 

- treat individuals as random effect

$$\large logit(p_i) \sim normal(logit(\mu_p), \tau_p)$$

--
- models with heterogeneity are not always identifiable 
    + different assumptions about $p_i$ will give different estimates of $N$ but model selection does not differentiate between models 
    
--
- however, *not* modeling individual heterogeneity leads to known bias
    + assuming constant $p$ underestimates $N$


---
## Model $\LARGE M_h$ in JAGS

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
model{
  omega ~ dbeta(1, 1)
  mean.p ~ dbeta(1, 1)
  mean.lp <- log(mean.p) - log(1 - mean.p)
  tau.p ~ dgamma(0.25, 0.25)
  
  for(i in 1:M){
    z[i] ~ dbern(psi)
    logit(p[i]) ~ dnorm(mean.lp, tau.p)T(-5, 5)
    
    y[i] ~ dbin(p[i] * z[i], T)
  } # end i
  
  N <- sum(z[1:M])
}
```

---
## Extensions of the Otis et al. models

#### Many extensions possible

- $\large M_{tb}$

- $\large M_{th}$

- $\large M_{tbh}$

- and many more limited only by your data and your modeling skills


--
#### As additional variation is added, more data is needed to estimate parameters

- all else equal, each new parameter results in lower precision for $\large N$ (no free lunch!)
