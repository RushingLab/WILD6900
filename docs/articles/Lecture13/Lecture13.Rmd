## Estimating abundance

#### Unbiased estimates of $\large N$ require estimating $\large p$

#### *Many* methods available:

- Mark-recapture  

- Removal sampling  

- Distance sampling  

- Double observer  

- N-mixture models

## Capture-mark-recapture (CMR)

#### CMR includes a **wide** variety of related techniques and models  

--
#### Traditionally, CMR referred to methods of capturing, marking, and then recapturing individuals at some point in the future  

--
#### This results in a **capture-history** for each individual:  

##### Individual 1: $101101$  
##### Individual 2: $011001$  

???

Individual 1 was captured on occasions 1, 3, 4, and 6  

Individual 2 was captured on occasions 2,3, and 6. 

--
#### From the capture-histories, possible to estimate $\large p$

--
#### With $\large p$, possible to estimate $\large N$

$$\large N = \frac{C}{p}$$

---
## Capture-mark-recapture

#### From capture-histories, we can estimate:  

--
- abundance  

--
- detection probability  

--
- survival  

--
- movement  

--
- recruitment  

--
- individual growth  

--
- populations trends

#### CMR methods are not restricted to physical captures and recaptures  

#### *What ties all of these methods together is that we have individual-level capture-histories*
