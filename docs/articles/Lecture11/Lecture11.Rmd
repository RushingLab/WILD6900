## Estimating abundance

#### Unbiased estimates of $\large N$ require estimating $\large p$

#### *Many* methods available:

- Mark-recapture  

- Removal sampling  

- Distance sampling  

- Double observer  

- N-mixture models

# Distance sampling

## Distance sampling

#### Basic idea

- Assume a population of $\large N$ individuals
    + $N \sim Poisson(\lambda)$
    + $n \sim binomial(N, \bar{p})$ 
    
--
- Each of the $N$ individuals is defined by:
      + $x_i$: the distance from the individual to a transect/point
      + $y_i$, whether the individual was detected or not during a survey
      
--
- Resonable to assume that detection probability $\large p_i$ is related to $\large x_i$   
    + i.e., $Pr(y_i = 1|x_i)$  

    + objects that are further away are harder to detect  


--
- Sample only includes individuals with $\large y = 1$
    + we only see distances $x_1, x_2, x_3, ...,x_n$ 
    
---
## Distance sampling

#### What does a histogram of the observed distances look like?

--
```{r fig.width=6, fig.height=6, echo = FALSE}
x <- runif(100, 0, 100)
sigma <- 30
p <- exp(-x^2/(2*sigma^2))

y <- rbinom(n = 100, size = 1, prob = p)

x.obs <- x[y==1]
hist(x.obs)
```


---
## Distance sampling

#### What is the probability of $\large x$ given $\large y = 1$? 

$$\Large [x|y=1]=\frac{[y=1|x][x]}{[y=1]}$$

--
- $\large [y=1|x]$ is a user-specified specified detection function
    + usually denoted $g(x, \theta)$
<br/>  


--
- $\large [x]$ is the *population distribution of distances*
<br/>  


--
- $\large [y=1]$ is the average detection probabilty over some interval $\large [0,B]$
    + aka $\bar{p}$
    + $\large \int_x^Bg(x,\theta)[x]dx$
    

---
## Distance sampling

#### One way to think about distance sampling is as a type of state-space model

1) The observation model is $\large g(x, \theta)$

- defined as the probability of detecting individuals as a function of distance

- describes how individuals **appear in the sample**

2) The state model is $\large [x]$

- defined as the probability that an individual is distance $x$ from the observer

- directly related to how individuals are distributed across the landscape

---
## Distance sampling

#### Models of detection probability

- Must be monotonically decreasing 

- Common models:
    + half normal: $\large e^{-x^2/2\sigma^2}$
    + negative exponential: $\large e^{-x/\sigma}$
    + hazard rate: $\large 1-e^{(x/\sigma)^{-b}}$
    
- Each model implies different relationship between $p$ and $x$
    + often multiple models are fit and compared using model selection

- All assume $g(0) = 1$ (detection is perfect at the transect)

- $\large \sigma$ defines shape of curve; must be estimated as a parameter in the model

---
## Distance sampling

#### How do we define the distribution $\large [x]$?

- Assume a line transect with length $L$ and maximum detection distance $B$

```{r out.width = "80%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/distance_transect.png")
```

--
- The area of the search are is $L \times 2B$


--
- If individuals are distributed uniformly with the sample region, then distance to the transect also has a uniform distribution
$$\Large [x] \sim uniform(0, B)$$

# Data augmentation

## Data augmentation

### Imagine an occupancy study:

- $\large M$ sites are surveyed  
    + $\large N$ sites are occupied $\large (z = 1)$
    + $\large M - N$ sites are unoccupied $\large (z = 0)$  

--
- species is detected $(y_i=1)$ at $n$ sites
    + species is not detected $(y_i=0)$ at $M-n$ sites  
    
--
$$\Large y_i \sim Bernoulli(z_i p)$$

---
## Data augmentation

### Imagine an occupancy study:

#### How many sites are actually occupied $\large (N)$?  

- if $\large \psi$ is the probability of occupancy

$$\Large z_i \sim Bernoulli(\psi)$$

--
- and

$$\Large N = \sum_{i=1}^M z_i$$

---
## Data augmentation

#### These ideas can be applied to distance sampling

#### Imagine a distance sampling study: 

- $\large n$ individuals were detected during the study

--
- $\large N-n$ individuals were not detected
    + how do we know how many individuals were not detected?  

--
- Add $\large M-n$ individuals to the data
    + Choose $M \gt \gt N$
    + All of these "augmented" individuals have $\large y=0$
    + Distances $\large x$ for augmented individuals are `NA` but have $uniform(0, B)$ prior

--
$$\large z_i \sim Bernoulli(\psi)$$

$$\large N = \sum_{i = 1}^M z_i$$

---
## Distance sampling

#### Bayesian formulation

- Process model:

$$\large z_i \sim Bernoulli(\psi)$$
$$\large x_i \sim uniform(0, B)$$

- Observation model:

$$\large p_i = g(x_i, \theta)$$

$$\large y_i \sim Bernoulli(z_i p_i)$$

- Derived variables

$$\large N = \sum_{i=1}^M z_i$$

$$\large D = \frac{N}{A}$$

## Distance sampling

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
model{
  # Priors 
  sigma ~ dunif(0, 1000)
  psi ~ dbeta(1, 1)
  
  # Likelihood
  for(i in 1:M){
    z[i] ~ dbern(psi)
    x[i] ~ dunif(0, B)
    
    ## Observation model
    log(p[i]) <- -((x[i] * x[i])/(2*sigma*sigma))
    y[i] ~ dbern(p[i] * z[i])
  }
  
  # Derived variables
  N <- sum(z[A:M])
  D <- N/A
}
```


---
## Distance sampling

#### Binned data

- Often, distances are recorded into $\large H$ "bins" rather than continuous $\large x$
    + 0-25m  
    + 26-50m  
    + 51-75m  
    + 76-100m  

--
- $\large y_h$ is the number of individuals detected in bin $\large h$
    + $\large \mathbf y = (y_1, y_2, ...,y_H)$
    + $\large n = \sum y_h$  

--
$$\Large \mathbf y|N \sim multinomial(N, \{\pi_h\})$$

---
## Distance sampling

#### Binned data

- $\large \{\pi_h\}$ is a vector of $H$ *cell probabilities*
    + "the probability that an individual occurs and is detected in distance bin $h$"
    + $\pi_h = \bar{p}_h \psi_h$

--
$$\Large \bar{p}_h = \int_{x \in h}Pr(y=1|x)/(b_{h+1}-b_h)dx$$

$$\Large \psi_h = (b_{h+1}-b_h)/B$$

$$\Large \pi_h = (1/B) \int_{x \in h}Pr(y=1|x, x \in h)$$ 

---
## Distance sampling

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
model{
  # Priors 
  sigma ~ dunif(0, 1000)
  psi ~ dbeta(1, 1)
  
  # Likelihood
  for(h in 1:H){
    log(p[h]) <- -(midpt[h]*midpt[h])/(2*sigma*sigma)
    pi[j] <- delta/B
  }
  
  for(i in 1:M){
    z[i] ~ dbern(psi)
    x[i] ~ dunif(0, B)
    
    ## Observation model
    p[i] <- exp(-((x[i] * x[i])/(2*sigma*sigma)))
    dclass[i] ~ dcat(pi[])
    y[i] ~ dbern(p[dclass[i]] * z[i])
  }
}
```
