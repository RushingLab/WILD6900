# Distance sampling

## Distance sampling

#### Basic idea

- Assume a population of $\large N$ individuals
    + $N \sim Poisson(\lambda)$
    + $n \sim binomial(N, \bar{p})$ 
    
--
- Each of the $N$ individuals is defined by:
      + $x_i$: the distance from the individual to a transect/point
      + $y_i$, whether the individual was detected or not during a survey
      
--
- Resonable to assume that detection probability $\large p_i$ is related to $\large x_i$   
    + i.e., $Pr(y_i = 1|x_i)$  

    + objects that are further away are harder to detect  


--
- Sample only includes individuals with $\large y = 1$
    + we only see distances $x_1, x_2, x_3, ...,x_n$ 
    
---
## Distance sampling

#### What does a histogram of the observed distances look like?

--
```{r fig.width=6, fig.height=6, echo = FALSE}
x <- runif(100, 0, 100)
sigma <- 30
p <- exp(-x^2/(2*sigma^2))

y <- rbinom(n = 100, size = 1, prob = p)

x.obs <- x[y==1]
hist(x.obs)
```


---
## Distance sampling

#### What is the probability of $\large x$ given $\large y = 1$? 

$$\Large [x|y=1]=\frac{[y=1|x][x]}{[y=1]}$$

--
- $\large [y=1|x]$ is a user-specified specified detection function
    + usually denoted $g(x, \theta)$
<br/>  


--
- $\large [x]$ is the *population distribution of distances*
<br/>  


--
- $\large [y=1]$ is the average detection probabilty over some interval $\large [0,B]$
    + aka $\bar{p}$
    + $\large \int_x^Bg(x,\theta)[x]dx$
    

---
## Distance sampling

#### One way to think about distance sampling is as a type of state-space model

1) The observation model is $\large g(x, \theta)$

- defined as the probability of detecting individuals as a function of distance

- describes how individuals **appear in the sample**

2) The state model is $\large [x]$

- defined as the probability that an individual is distance $x$ from the observer

- directly related to how individuals are distributed across the landscape

---
## Distance sampling

#### Models of detection probability

- Must be monotonically decreasing 

- Common models:
    + half normal: $\large e^{-x^2/2\sigma^2}$
    + negative exponential: $\large e^{-x/\sigma}$
    + hazard rate: $\large 1-e^{(x/\sigma)^{-b}}$
    
- Each model implies different relationship between $p$ and $x$
    + often multiple models are fit and compared using model selection

- All assume $g(0) = 1$ (detection is perfect at the transect)

- $\large \sigma$ defines shape of curve; must be estimated as a parameter in the model

---
## Distance sampling

#### How do we define the distribution $\large [x]$?

- Assume a line transect with length $L$ and maximum detection distance $B$

```{r out.width = "80%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/distance_transect.png")
```

--
- The area of the search is $L \times 2B$


--
- If individuals are distributed uniformly with the sample region, then distance to the transect also has a uniform distribution
$$\Large [x] \sim uniform(0, B)$$

# Data augmentation

## Data augmentation

### Imagine an occupancy study:

- $\large M$ sites are surveyed  
    + $\large N$ sites are occupied $\large (z = 1)$
    + $\large M - N$ sites are unoccupied $\large (z = 0)$  

--
- species is detected $(y_i=1)$ at $n$ sites
    + species is not detected $(y_i=0)$ at $M-n$ sites  
    
--
$$\Large y_i \sim Bernoulli(z_i p)$$

---
## Data augmentation

### Imagine an occupancy study:

#### How many sites are actually occupied $\large (N)$?  

- if $\large \psi$ is the probability of occupancy

$$\Large z_i \sim Bernoulli(\psi)$$

--
- and

$$\Large N = \sum_{i=1}^M z_i$$

---
## Data augmentation

#### These ideas can be applied to distance sampling

#### Imagine a distance sampling study: 

- $\large n$ individuals were detected during the study

--
- $\large N-n$ individuals were not detected
    + how do we know how many individuals were not detected?  

--
- Add $\large M-n$ individuals to the data
    + Choose $M \gt \gt N$
    + All of these "augmented" individuals have $\large y=0$
    + Distances $\large x$ for augmented individuals are `NA` but have $uniform(0, B)$ prior

--
$$\large z_i \sim Bernoulli(\psi)$$

$$\large N = \sum_{i = 1}^M z_i$$

---
## Distance sampling

#### Bayesian formulation

- Process model:

$$\large z_i \sim Bernoulli(\psi)$$
$$\large x_i \sim uniform(0, B)$$

- Observation model:

$$\large p_i = g(x_i, \theta)$$

$$\large y_i \sim Bernoulli(z_i p_i)$$

- Derived variables

$$\large N = \sum_{i=1}^M z_i$$

$$\large D = \frac{N}{A}$$

---
## Distance sampling

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
model{
  # Priors 
  sigma ~ dunif(0, 1000)
  psi ~ dbeta(1, 1)
  
  # Likelihood
  for(i in 1:M){
    z[i] ~ dbern(psi)
    x[i] ~ dunif(0, B)
    
    ## Observation model
    log(p[i]) <- -((x[i] * x[i])/(2*sigma*sigma))
    y[i] ~ dbern(p[i] * z[i])
  }
  
  # Derived variables
  N <- sum(z[A:M])
  D <- N/A
}
```


---
## Distance sampling

```{r include = FALSE}
N <- 1000
sigma <- 1
B <- 3
u1 <- runif(N, 0, 2*B)
u2 <- runif(N, 0, 2*B)

d <- sqrt((u1-B)^2 + (u2 - B)^2)
d2 <- d[d <= B]

N.real <- length(d2)

p <- exp(-d2*d2/(2*sigma^2))

y <- rbinom(N.real, 1, p)

ptd <- data.frame(distance = c(d2, d2[y==1]),
                  group = c(rep("True", N.real), rep("Observed", length(d2[y==1]))))

circ_df <- data.frame(x = u1[d <= B],
                      y = u2[d <= B],
                      p = p)
```

#### Point transect data

- With line transect data & assumption of uniform distribution:

$$\Large Pr(x)= 1/B$$

--
- But with circular point counts, distances are not uniformly distributed because area gets bigger as $x$ gets bigger:

$$\Large Pr(x) = \frac{2x}{B^2}$$
```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=4}
library(ggforce)
circles <- data.frame(
  x0 = rep(3, 3),
  y0 = rep(3, 3),
  r = 1:3
)
ggplot() + 
  geom_circle(aes(x0 = x0, y0 = y0, r = r), data = circles) +
  geom_point(data = circ_df, aes(x, y, color = p), size = 1) +
  coord_fixed()
```

---
## Distance sampling

#### Observed vs. true distances

```{r, fig.height=5, fig.width=7}
ggplot(ptd, aes(x = distance, color = group)) + geom_freqpoly(size = 1.5)
```

## Putting the *hierarchy* in HDS

#### Typical distance sampling data

```{r}
library(kableExtra)
N_df <- data.frame(Transect = c(1, 2, 3, "S"),
                   dclass1 = c(2, 3, 2, 4),
                   dclass2 = c(0, 0, 1, 2),
                   dclass3 = c(1,0, 1, 0),
                   X1 = c("x11", "x21", "x31", "xs1"),
                   XS = c("x12", "x22", "x32", "xs2"))

knitr::kable(N_df,format = 'html') %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = F)
```

## Putting the *hierarchy* in HDS

#### Model structure - binned data

$$\Large N_s \sim Poisson(\lambda_s)$$

$$\Large log(\lambda_s) = \beta_0 + \beta1 x_{s1}$$
--
$$\Large (y_{s1}, y_{s2}, y_{s3}) \sim multinomial(N_s, \{\pi_s\})$$
--
$$\Large \pi_{s,h}= \underbrace{\bar{p}_h}_{average\; detection\; prob} \underbrace{\frac{b_{h+1}-b_h}{B}}_{prob. \; x \; in\; h}$$

$$\Large log(\sigma_s) = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 x_{s2}$$
