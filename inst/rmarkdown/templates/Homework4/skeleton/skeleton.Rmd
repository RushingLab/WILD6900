**Due date: 27 February, 2020 before class**

After you have modified the code according to the instructions, change `eval = FALSE` to `eval = TRUE` in the `setup` chunk above (line 12). Once this option is changed, **do not** modify any of the chunk options below.  

Refer to the [instructions for submitted homework assignments](https://rushinglab.github.io/WILD6900/articles/homework.html) prior to submission

In this homework assignment, you will continue to explore fitting hierarchical models in JAGS by simulating data that is similar in structure to the data you work with as part of your research. 

## Formulating the data and model

When you design a research project, it's a good idea to think very hard about the model you will be using to analyze your data before you collect a single data point. Formulating the model ahead of time allows you to focus on how the output from that model will help answer your research questions and what data will be necessary to fit the model. Having the model formulated ahead of time also allows you to conduct simulation-based studies to assess whether the model does what you think it does, perform power analyses specific to your model, and identify potential analytical issues while there is still time to revise your sampling protocol. In this assignment, you will go through the steps of formulating a model and performing a simulation study based on your research questions. This does not need to be a full-blown simulation study, just a small example of how this process works. If you already have a well-formulated question and even some data, that's great. If not, just come up with a question consistent with what you think you'll be doing. If you can, use this assignment to get a head start on your project. 

**The one condition is that your model must be hierarchical (i.e., it must include at least one random effect)!**

As you think about the model, answer the following questions (type your answer in bold below the question):

> 1) What are the state variables you need to estimate in order to answer these questions? 

> 2) What are the parameters that govern that state variable? How 

> 3) What are the hypothesized relationships between the parameters and state variables? Express your answer to this question in terms of a mathmatical, deterministic process model. If you need more than one equation, add as many as you need

$$insert\; equation\; here$$

> 4) How does process uncertainty enter your system? Express your answer to this question in terms of a stochastic model. If you need more than one equation, add as many as you need

$$insert\; equation\; here$$

> 5) What is the observational unit of your study, i.e., what do your data look like?

> 6) Do you observe the state variable(s) perfectly? If not, formulate an observation model and express this model mathmatically.  If you need more than one equation, add as many as you need

$$insert\; equation\; here$$

## Simulating the data

We've already seen several examples of simulating data in class. In the chunk below, include whatever code is necessary to simulate a single realization of your hypothesized systems. Choose sample sizes and parameter values that you think are consistent with your data/system.

```{r sim_data}


```

## Translating the model into code

Next, translate the model you specified above into working JAGS code. Choose reasonable priors for each parameter (priors can be informative or uninformative)

***
**Important** - in order for the .Rmd file to knit properly, complete the model code below and then manually run the code to create the .jags file (highlighting the chunk below and clicking `Run` or `command + return`). Leave the `eval = FALSE` option set to false so that `knitr` does **not** try to run the code when you knit the document!

***

```{r eval = FALSE}
sink("sim_mod.jags")
cat("
model{
  # Priors

  # Likelihood

} # end of model
", fill = TRUE)
sink()
```


## Fitting the model and checking the results

In the chunk below, add the code necessary to fit the model to your simulated data set:


```{r fit_data}


```

> 7) Write a brief paragraph below detailing the results from your simulation. How close were the estimated parameters to the true values? Why might they differ? Do you think these differences are systematic (i.e., bias) and what information would you need to assess bias? Use inline `R` code to reference values/results rather than typing the values manually. Also, add a single visualization that is relevant for interpreting your results (any figure you think is appropriate will do)

```{r fig, echo = FALSE}


```
