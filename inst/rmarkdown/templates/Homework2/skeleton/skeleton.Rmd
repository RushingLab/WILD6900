In this homework, you will further develop your understanding of Markov Chain monte carlo by building a custom MCMC to estimate the parameters of a probability distribution from data. So called "curve fitting" is common in ecology, especially in dispersal studies, and involves many of the concepts we have already seen this semester - we choose a probability distribution and then use observed data to estimate the parameters that define the shape of that distribution. In this assignment, you will estimate the parameters of a distribution by building a custom MCMC model and using JAGS. 

### The distribution

There are many possible distributions that can be used to characterize patterns in ecology (e.g., dispersal kernels). How to choose among these models is beyond the scope of this assignment so we will use a fairly common model, the Weibull distribution. The Weibull distribution is defined by two parameters the shape (which we'll denote $k$) and the scale (which we'll denote $\lambda$). The Weibull is a popular choice to characterize many ecological processes because it is very flexible $-$ when $k = 1$ the Weibull simplifies to the negative exponential distribution; as $k$ approaches $0$, the probability of large values (e.g., long-distance dispersal events) becomes more common. The pdf of the Weibull distribution is:

$$\Large [x|k, \lambda] = \frac{k}{\lambda} \bigg(\frac{x}{\lambda}\bigg)^{k-1} e^{-(x/ \lambda)^k}$$

Luckily, you'll probably never need to know that because both `R` and JAGS have built-in functions to calculate the probability density of the Weibull distribution.

### Simulating the data

> In the chunk below, use the `rweibull()` function to simulate 500 observations from a Weibull distribution. Call this object `x` and create a histogram of the simulated data. Choose whatever $k$ and $\lambda$ values you think create a sensible dispersal kernel (you may also want to create objects called `k` and `lambda` so you can call these values later and only have to change them in one place). 

```{r sim-data}

```

Next, you will be an MCMC to estimate $k$ and $\lambda$ from the observed data. Knowing the true values will help you make sure your code is doing what you think its doing. 

## Custom MCMC

Building an MCMC for a model with two parameters is challenging but not beyond your ability. Before proceeding, go back to lecture 5 and the lab on MCMC to refresh yourself on the steps and some of the code we used to estimate $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\sigma$ in the regression example. You will need to modify that code to complete the assignment but everything you need is in those examples. 

First, you need choose priors for $k$ and $\lambda$ and create helper functions that return the prior probability of different values. Despite what we learned about priors, we'll use uninformative $uniform(0, 10)$ priors for this example. 

> In the chunk below, complete the code necessary to create the helper functions. Note that each function will take a single argument and should return the (log) probability density of observing a particular value of $k$ and $\lambda$ assuming a $uniform(0,10)$ prior

```{r priorFunctions}
priorK <- function(){

  return(prob)
} 

priorLambda <- function(){
  
  return(prob)
} 
```

Next, we'll create another helper function to calculate the (log) likelihood of the observed data given values of $k$ and $\lambda$. 

> In the chunk below, use the `dweibull()` function to calculate the total (log) likelihood of the data. Hint - the function will take three arguments (the data, $k$, and $\lambda$)

```{r likeFunction}
calc_like <- function() {
  
  return(sum(loglike))
}
```

More helper functions. This time, you will create helper functions to generate proposal values of $k$ and $\lambda$. 

> In the chunk below, complete the code to create the helper functions. Hints - the functions will take two arguments (the current value of the parameter and the tuning parameter (call that `sigma`)); the Weibull distribution is only defined for $k > 0$ and $\lambda > 0$ so your proposal function shouldn't return values less than or equal to 0. Instead of deriving a complex proposal function, just use the `max()` function to return a very small value (e.g., 0.001) if the proposed value is $\leq 0$

```{r proposalFunctions}
proposalK <- function(){

  return(proposal)
}

proposalLambda <- function(){

  return(proposal)
}
```

Before create the MCMC code, let's set up some basic parameters of the algorithm. 

> In the chunk below, decide on the length of the chains and the tuning parameter. The data frame that's created next will store value of $k$ and $\lambda$ and whether each iteration is accepted or rejected (helpful to calculate the acceptance rate). Use the `runif()` function to generate initial values for each parameter. Finally, use the `calc_like()` function to calculate the likelihood of the data given the initial vales

```{r MCMCsetup}
## Length of chains
nIter <- 

## Tuning parameter
tuning <- 

## Empty data frame to store posterior samples of each parameter
mcmc_df <- data.frame(iteration = 1:nIter,
                      k = numeric(nIter),
                      lambda= numeric(nIter),
                      k.accept = 0,
                      lambda.accept = 0)

## Initial values
mcmc_df$k[1] <-  
mcmc_df$lambda[1] <- 

## Likelihood of initial values
likelihood <- 

```

Now you're ready to write the MCMC itself. I have included "pseudo-code" in the chunk below to walk you through the steps. Refer back to the MCMC lab for help if you get stuck $-$ this is almost identical to the regression model. 

> Complete the code to set up the MCMC

```{r MCMC}
for(i in 2:nIter){
########################
#### 1. Update k
########################

## 1a: Generate candidate value
candK <- 

## 1b: Calculate likelihood at candidate value
cand_like <- 

## 1c: Calculate likelihood * prior at old value and candidate value
jointOld <- 
jointCand <- 

## 1d: Acceptance probability 
R <- 

## 1e: Decide whether to accept or not
if() {   # if accepted
  mcmc_df$k[i] <-
  mcmc_df$k.accept[i] <-
  likelihood <- 
} else {
  mcmc_df$k[i] <-
}

########################
#### 2. Update lambda
########################

## 2a: Generate candidate value
candLambda <- 

## 2b: Calculate likelihood at candidate value
cand_like <- 

## 2c: Calculate likelihood * prior at old value and candidate value
jointOld <- 
jointCand <- 

## 2d: Acceptance probability 
R <- 

## 2e: Decide whether to accept or not
if() {   # if accepted
  mcmc_df$lambda[i] <-
  mcmc_df$lambda.accept[i] <- 
  likelihood <-
} else {
  mcmc_df$lambda[i] <-
}
}
```

Did it work? 

> In the chunk below, use the `quantile()` function to look at the median and quantiles of the posteriors for $k$ and $\lambda$. Are they close the true values?

```{r posteriors}

```

You can also compare the posterior estimates to the MLE estimates using the following code:
```{r mle}
MASS::fitdistr(x, densfun = "weibull")
```

Are they similar? 

Finally, you can visualize the chains.

> Complete the ggplot2 code below to view the chains for $k$ and $\lambda$. Even though we can't assess convergence with only one chain, do the chains look well-behaved? Type a short answer in **bold** below

```{r vizMCMC}
ggplot(, aes(x = , y = )) + geom_path()
```

> In the chunk below, estimate the acceptance rate for each parameter (hint - use the `mean()` function). Change the tuning parameter. How does it influence the acceptance rate? How does it influence mixing and convergence of the chains? Type a short answer in **bold** below

```{r acceptance}

```

## Fitting the model in JAGS

Now that you've done the hard work of writing your own MCMC, you can do things the "easy" way and fit the same model in JAGS.


> Complete the JAGS code below. Note that JAGS uses a slightly different parameterization of the Weibull so I've include a line to derive lambda from another parameter called `b` (include a prior on $b$ just like you did for $\lambda$ in the previous model but then use `lambda` in the likelihood statement). Note that JAGS has a built-in function `dweib()`

***
**Important** - in order for the .Rmd file to knit properly, complete the model code below and then manually run the code to create the .jags file (highlighting the chunk below and clicking `Run` or `command + return`). Leave the `eval = FALSE` option set to false so that `knitr` does **not** try to run the code when you knit the document!

***

```{r eval = FALSE}
sink("weibull.jags")
cat("
model{
  # Priors

  lambda <- pow(1/k, b)
  
  # Likelihood
  for(i in 1:N){

  }
} # end of model
", fill = TRUE)
sink()
```

Now create the objects that JAGS needs to fit the model:

> Complete the `jags_data <- list()` object to include all necessary input to run the model

```{r}
jags_data <- list()
```

> Complete the `jags_inits` function to include all necessary initial values to run the model. Use the `runif()` function to generate random initial values each time you run the model

```{r}
jags_inits <- function(){list()}
```


> Complete the `params <- c()` object to include parameters you would like to monitor

```{r}
params <- c()
```

> Complete the MCMC settings. Run 3 chains for 10,000 iterations, discarding the first 1000 samples as burn-in

```{r}
ni <- 
nc <- 
nb <- 
```

Assuming all information above is completed correctly, the following code should run without error:

```{r include = FALSE}
weib_mod <- jagsUI::jags(data = jags_data, inits = jags_inits, 
                              parameters.to.save = params, model.file = "weibull.jags",
                              n.chains = nc, n.iter = ni, n.thin = 1, n.burnin = nb)
```


> Check the model for convergence. Did the model converge? Type your answer in **bold** below, providing at least two sources of evidence for convergence. If the model did not converge, change your settings above and re-run. What did you change?

```{r convergence}

```

> How close were the estimates from the custom MCMC and JAGS
