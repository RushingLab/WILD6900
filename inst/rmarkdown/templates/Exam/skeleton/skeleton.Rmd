**Due date: 4 April, 2020 before class**

The exam consists of 5 questions, each worth 10 points. For each question, include all code necessary to format/clean data, create and fit model files, check convergence, and visualize model output. 

Refer to the [instructions for submitted homework assignments](https://rushinglab.github.io/WILD6900/articles/homework.html) prior to submission

***

> 1) For each of the data types below, indicate a reasonable distribution that could be used to describe the data generating process. Type your answer in **bold** after each data type

- Height of humans:

- Salinity:

- 


> 2) Prior question



> 3) Remember that a conventional t-test is used to test for differences the mean of two populations. A critical assumption of this method is equal variances - that is, both populations have the same variance in the measured response variable. 

> 3a) If the equations below describe a standard t-test, what are the possible values of $x_i$? 

$$y_i = \alpha + \beta \times x_i + \epsilon_i$$

$$\epsilon_i \sim normal(0, \tau)$$

> 3b) Change the above equations to represent a model with unequal variances. 

> 3c) The JAGS code below can be used to fit the standard t-test. Change the code to match the model you described in question 3b (hint - there are numerous ways to code this model. One efficient way to do so is to recongize that x + 1 will always equal either 1 or 2. So if you have an object that is a vector of length 2, you can subset the first element or the second using each individual's value of x)

```{r eval = FALSE}
model{
  # Priors
  alpha ~ dnorm(0, 0.33)
  beta ~ dnrom(0, 0.33)
  tau ~ dunif(0, 10)
  
  # Likelihood
  for(i in 1:N){
    lp[i] <- alpha + beta * x[i]
    y[i] ~ dnorm(lp[i], tau)
  }
} # end of model
```

> 3d) In the model above, what is the ecological interpretation of $\alpha$ and $\beta$?

> 3e) In the model code above, create a new variable called alpha2 that measures the mean of group 2

> 4) Custom design matrix using lm

GLMM (logistic regression) in JAGS


> 5) Fit model 4 in JAGS

State-space logistic regression in JAGS
