**Due date: 4 April, 2019 before class**

After you have modified the code according to the instructions, change `eval = FALSE` to `eval = TRUE` in the `setup` chunk above (line 12). Once this option is changed, **do not** modify any of the chunk options below.  

Refer to the [instructions for submitted homework assignments](https://rushinglab.github.io/WILD6900/articles/homework.html) prior to submission

For this assignment, you need to translate the "psuedo-code" below into a working simulation study. The objective is to use simulated data to investigate how the number of survey occasions influences uncertainty about $\psi$, $p$, and the power to detect whether occupancy probability differs among habitats.  


First, you will simulate the "full" data set, which includes the true state (0/1) of each study site and the observed state (0/1) for each of the $K$ occasions:

```{r data_sim}
set.seed(53) # Do not change

### 1) Create variables to store the number of sites per habitat type (set to 150) and the number of visits (set to 10)

### 2) Set the habitat-specific occupancy probabilities (set psi1 to 0.75 and psi2 to 0.6)

### 3) Set the detection probability (constant for both habitats, set to 0.4)

### 4a) Randomly generate the true state of sites in habitat 1 (hint - the rbinom function with size = 1 will generate n values from a Bernoulli distribution)

### 4b) Randomly generate the true state of sites in habitat 2 

### 4c) Combine the objects you just created into a single vector indicating the true state of all 150 sites

### 4d) Create a vector indicating whether each point was in habitat type 1 (value = 1) or habitat type 2 (value = 2)

### 5a) Create an empty NxK matrix to store the observations for each site

### 5b) Loop over each site to randomly generate observations 
####    hint 1: use the rbinom function to fill in the entire row of observations for each site with a single line of code)
####    hint 2: Remember that we can use the state-space formulation to ensure that sites with z = 0 always have y = 0

```

With the simulated data created, you're now ready to write the JAGS model. In the model, be sure to:

- Create separate priors for `psi[1]` and `psi[2]`

- Inside the likelihood, use the habitat type vector you created in step 4d to index the correct `psi` value for each site

- Create a derived variable called `delta_psi` that is the difference between `psi[1]` and `psi[2]`

***
**Important** - in order for the .Rmd file to knit properly, complete the model code below and then manually run the code to create the .jags file (highlighting the chunk below and clicking `Run` or `command + return`). Leave the `eval = FALSE` option set to false so that `knitr` does **not** try to run the code when you knit the document!

***

```{r eval = FALSE}
sink("Occ.jags")
cat("
model{
  # Priors

  # Likelihood
  for(i in 1:M){

  }
} # end of model
", fill = TRUE)
sink()
```

Now create the objects that JAGS needs to fit the full model. One thing that is key to getting this model to run is providing good initial values for `x[i]`. To do this, use the `apply` function to set the initial value of `x` as a vector containing the maximum observed value at each site:


```{r}
## Bundle data
jags_data <- list()

## Initial values; be sure to include initial values for x
jags_inits <- function(){list()}

## Parameters to model
params <- c()

## MCMC settings
ni <- 
nc <- 
nb <- 
```

Assuming all information above is completed correctly, the following code should run without error:

```{r include = FALSE}
fit_full <- jagsUI::jags(data = jags_data, inits = inits, 
                         parameters.to.save = params, model.file = "occ.jags",
                         n.chains = nc, n.iter = ni, n.thin = 1, n.burnin = nb)
```


Be sure to check the model for convergence and refit if necessary 

### "Power analysis" - detecting differences in $\psi$ as a function of $K$

In the chunks below, refit the same model as you did above but this time only using a subset of the occasions. Rather than re-simulating the data, you can simply change the $k$ loop in JAGS so that you only loop over a subset of the columns in $y$. In fact, you don't even have the change the model code at all $-$ simply change the value of $K$ in the data object. This trick not only saves you from having to re-simulate the data, it ensures that the true state $z$ is the same for all of the data you analyze, ensuring that the only source of variation between models is the number of observations. 

In each chunk, copy whatever lines of code you need to re-bundle the data and refit the model, reducing the number of occasions by 1 in each chunk (if you're feeling clever you can do this using a loop instead). Be sure to change the name of the fitted model objects so you end up with 9 separate model objects. 

```{r k9}
# Enter code for k = 9 here
```

```{r k8}
# Enter code for k = 8 here
```

```{r k7}
# Enter code for k = 7 here
```

```{r k6}
# Enter code for k = 6 here
```

```{r k5}
# Enter code for k = 5 here
```

```{r k4}
# Enter code for k = 4 here
```

```{r k3}
# Enter code for k = 3 here
```

```{r k2}
# Enter code for k = 2 here
```

Finally, make a plot showing the estimated $\Delta_{\psi}$ for each model as a function of $K$. This plot should be "publication quality" so be sure that:

1) The axes are labeled correctly

2) The graph shows both the posterior mean of $\Delta_{\psi}$ as well as the 95% credible interval

3) There are horizontal lines showing the true $\Delta_{\psi}$ and 0

```{r fig.width=6, fig.height=6}
# Enter figure code here
```

### Questions

**1) How did your estimate of $\Delta_{\psi}$ change as the number of occasions increased? Provide a brief explanation for the link between $K$ and $\Delta_{\psi}$**

**2) This not a very good power analysis because we just looked at a single realization of a stochastic process and because we only simulated data under a single combination of parameters. Briefly describe how you would design a more informative  analysis to examine the factors that influence your power to detect differences in $\psi$ between two habitat types**
